    "In today's exercise, we're going to use OpenRouteServices, a free routing and network analysis service, run on open-source software. We have two tasks for the day: 1) to write Python code that will permit us to collect routes from one point to another, and 2) to write Python code that will permit us to collect isochrones for individual points based on transit mode. Isochrones are polygons that depict network distance---in other words, how far can I travel along a road network given a certain amount of time?\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, the first task is to get an [OpenRouteServices API key](https://openrouteservice.org/). The free plan is a bit constrained (500 isochrone requests per day, 2000 directions requests per day), but it will be totally fine for our purposes! Once you've created an account, copy your API key---you'll need it later!"

    "We begin by creating a new virtual environment for our routing work. As a reminder, a virtual environment is a self-contained Python environment, generally built to accommodate a specific project. We use these so that we're not endlessly installing pacakges into a single bloated environment; instead, we work only with those packages we need. \n",

    "cd path/to/your/data/\n",
    "```\n",

    "```sh\n",
    "# Tells python 3 to run the venv module...\n",
    "# ...and create a new virtual environment...\n",

    "\n",
    "# On Windows...\n",
    "python -m venv venv\\\n",

    "# The next line of your prompt should begin (venv)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we've activated our virtual environment, any packages we install will be specific to this environment---this is very useful for managing packages on a project-by-project basis. We're going to install the `openrouteservices` package, which is a fairly thin wrapper for the OpenRouteService API (by 'thin wrapper', I just mean that it provides convenience functions without contributing much in the way of added functionality). We're also going to install `python-dotenv` and `shapely`. The former allows us to store API keys and other secrets in a file that doesn't ever go anywhere near our git repository; we'll use the latter to store coordinates returned by OpenRouteService in what's called 'Well-Known Text'.\n",

This is the location of curent T stops in Cambridge and Somerville from MassGIS; I've extended it to also include the planned Green Line Extension stops (which means that technically, the file includes a stop in Medford as well). Let's first make sure we are comfortable looping through rows in a CSV file; our approach will be to loop through and, for each feature, produce as isochrone that we append as a geometry!\n",

We then iterate through its lines printing the values stored in the `STATION` column. Why do this instead of simply looping through rows? Good question! Because I like the ability to reference columns by name, which requires that we represent the CSV in a way that gives us access to headers. We could also do this using, for example, Pandas dataframes. But I'm trying to keep this as simple as possible."

Kudos! You've built an isochrone tool that returns a CSV storing the isochrone geoemtries as Well-Known Text (WKT). QGIS can interpret this easily, as can PostGIS and other GISystems."
